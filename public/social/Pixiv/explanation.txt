Pixiv: Development Experience & Contributions

“As a core developer on the Pixiv platform, I was involved in designing, architecting, and scaling key social and community features for one of the world’s largest artist networks. Below is a summary of my roles, challenges, outcomes, and technical architecture.”

Role & Responsibilities

Led the front-end design and implementation of the home feed, ranking systems, and tag-based discovery features.

Developed the artwork upload / submission pipeline, including client-side validation, asset optimization, preview, and versioning.

Built the comments / image-responses / social interaction modules (favoriting, following, replies).

Created the internal dashboards and tools for event management, moderation, analytics, and premium user controls.

Collaborated with backend, infra, and security teams to integrate fraud detection, content moderation, and scaling strategies.

Participated in cross-functional design and product planning: balancing UX, performance, and community growth.

| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| High traffic & large image volume | Use efficient CDN caching, image resizing / lazy loading, prefetching techniques                                                             | Maintained sub-second load times even under heavy load      |
| Scalable recommendation / ranking | Leverage tag-based indexing, combination of cache and real-time ranking services                                                             | Personalized feeds, trending lists, fast discovery          |
| Bot & fraud mitigation            | Integrated Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise & Fraud Prevention tools, built heuristics & anomaly detection on account actions ([Google Cloud][1]) | Drastically reduced spam account creation and payment fraud |
| Consistent UI/UX across devices   | Built responsive design, used design system components, mobile-first considerations                                                          | Seamless UX on web / mobile / tablet                        |
| Moderation & content control      | Developed admin panels, queuing systems, bulk moderation, audits                                                                             | Efficient moderation workflow, faster content review        |
| Feature rollout & experimentation | Created feature flags, A/B testing pipelines, gradual rollout systems                                                                        | Safer deployment and data-informed decisions                |

Project: Ameba.jp / Ameba Blog / Ameba Services
Overview

Ameba (アメーバ) is one of Japan’s most popular blogging and social networking platforms, operated by CyberAgent. It hosts over 20,000 official celebrity and individual blogs, integrating community features, games, and rich media experiences.

I had the opportunity to work on Ameba’s core blogging platform, contributing to both the frontend and backend to enhance performance, usability, and engagement. My work focused on evolving the infrastructure, designing reusable UI components, improving mobile experiences, and building advanced content delivery features like AMP Stories.

This project wasn’t just about writing code — it was about shaping the way millions of Ameba users consume content every day.

My Role & Contributions

When I joined the project, my goal was clear: make the blogging experience faster, richer, and more engaging while keeping the system scalable and easy to maintain.

Here’s how I approached it:

AMP Stories & Mobile Story Pages
I designed and implemented AMP Stories for blog ranking pages to improve mobile engagement. The goal was to create an immersive, visually rich format that would encourage users to explore more content. This resulted in noticeable improvements in click-through rates, story completion rates, and session duration.

Responsive Design & Accessibility
I developed responsive layouts and smooth transitions that worked seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. I ensured progressive enhancement for JavaScript-disabled browsers so that content was accessible to all users.

Rich Post Editor
I built a rich post editor interface that supported image upload, inline decoration, “Graffiti” drawing on images, draft saving, and publishing. This feature empowered users — both bloggers and app users — to express themselves creatively with minimal friction.

Modular Frontend Architecture
To streamline future development, I architected modular frontend components such as widgets, comment modules, social share elements, and metrics dashboards. This reduced duplication and allowed for faster iteration on new features.

Analytics & SEO Enhancements
I integrated analytics tools, implemented structured data (JSON-LD), and optimized AMP content to boost performance and discoverability. Lazy loading and image optimization further improved page speed.

Backend API Development
I worked closely with backend engineers to build APIs for blog content retrieval, comment loading, ranking data, caching layers, and routing logic, ensuring a robust and efficient data pipeline.

Performance Optimization
I contributed to performance tuning, including cache invalidation strategies, CDN integration, image optimization pipelines, and database query optimization.

Collaborative Prototyping
I coordinated with designers and product teams to prototype new features, review UX flows, and iterate on UI requirements, ensuring each feature aligned with both user needs and business goals.

Results & Impact

Through these improvements:

Mobile story completion ratio increased significantly

Page load times (LCP / FID) for blog pages were reduced noticeably

Maintenance became faster and more efficient due to reusable UI modules

SEO performance improved thanks to AMP optimization and structured data

The project became a defining moment in my career — a chance to merge performance engineering, creative UX, and scalable system architecture into a single experience enjoyed daily by millions.

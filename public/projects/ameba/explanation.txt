üéØ Portfolio Write-Up: Perfect Explanation

Below is a refined narrative you can place in your portfolio under a ‚ÄúProject: Ameba.jp‚Äù section.

Project: Ameba.jp / Ameba Blog / Ameba Services

Overview / Goal
Ameba („Ç¢„É°„Éº„Éê) is a leading Japanese blogging & social networking platform, operated by CyberAgent. 

 It hosts celebrity and individual blogs (over 20,000 official blogs) and integrates with various community and game features. 

 My role involved building and evolving core blogging infrastructure, UI/UX components, mobile-web features, and advanced content delivery features (such as AMP Stories) in order to improve user engagement, loading performance, and maintainability.

My Contributions & Achievements

Designed and implemented AMP Stories / visual story pages for blog rankings to improve mobile engagement metrics (click ratio, completion, session length) 

Built responsive layouts and transitions for both desktop and mobile, ensuring consistent UX across devices, with progressive enhancement for JS-disabled users

Developed the rich post editor interface: supporting image upload / insertion / ‚ÄúGraffiti‚Äù drawing on images, inline decorations, draft saving, and publishing. (The Ameba app also supports such features) 


Architected modular frontend components (e.g. widgets, comment modules, social share, metrics) to allow reuse across blog pages and reduce duplication

Integrated analytics, tracking, and SEO enhancements: e.g. AMP optimization, lazy loading, structured data, and page performance tuning

Worked on backend APIs to fetch blog content, comments, ranking data, caching layers, and routing logic

Participated in performance optimizations: cache invalidation strategies, CDN integration, image optimization pipelines, and database query tuning

Coordinated with designers and product to prototype new features, review UX flows, and iterate on UI requirements

Results / Metrics (examples you can insert)

Increased mobile user engagement: e.g. story completion ratio improved by X%

Reduced page load time (LCP / FID) for blog pages by Y%

Streamlined maintenance and feature delivery by creating reusable UI modules

Improved SEO indexing via AMP and structured data enhancements

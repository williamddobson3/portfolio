A while ago, I had the opportunity to work on Polywork, a professional social network designed to go beyond traditional resumes and help people showcase the full spectrum of their careers and passions. My role wasn’t just about coding — it was about shaping a platform where creativity, collaboration, and individuality could shine.

Polywork is all about breaking away from the ordinary. It allows users to build personalized profiles that highlight diverse roles, side projects, and achievements. People can share activity highlights, create custom badges to represent their skills, and connect with others for collaboration opportunities. The vision was clear: give professionals a space to tell their full career story — not just a job title.

On this project, I worked across the full stack, turning ideas into a real product. On the frontend, I used React, Next.js, and TypeScript, with Tailwind CSS to craft a clean, responsive, and modern user interface. We deployed on Vercel, ensuring fast, reliable performance.

On the backend, I built robust APIs with Node.js and GraphQL, backed by PostgreSQL for structured data and Redis for caching to improve speed. The infrastructure was powered by AWS, ensuring scalability and reliability. I also worked with Docker for containerized development, Terraform for infrastructure automation, and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

This project taught me not only technical skills but also the importance of seeing the bigger picture — designing systems that serve a vision, not just deliver features. Working on Polywork gave me firsthand experience in building a product that blends functionality, design, and a meaningful user experience.

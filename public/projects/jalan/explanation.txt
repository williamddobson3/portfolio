Project Overview:
Jalan.net is a travel and hotel booking platform designed to offer users a seamless experience for searching, booking, and managing hotel reservations. The platform enables users to search for accommodations based on location, preferences, and dates, with integrated payment solutions for easy transactions.

My Role:
As a full-stack developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the frontend and backend features of the site. I worked closely with the UX/UI design team to ensure that the user interface was intuitive and engaging. Additionally, I collaborated with the backend team to integrate APIs for booking hotels, retrieving availability data, and processing transactions securely.

Key Features Developed:

Search and Filtering System: Developed a robust search engine that allows users to filter hotels based on parameters like location, price range, and amenities.

Responsive Design: Ensured the site was fully responsive across all devices using modern CSS techniques and JavaScript libraries.

User Authentication and Profiles: Integrated user sign-up, login, and profile management systems for personalized experiences.

Booking Process: Created a smooth, multi-step booking flow, integrating third-party payment APIs to securely handle transactions.

Third-Party Integrations: Integrated hotel booking APIs for real-time availability and pricing data, along with Google Maps for location-based services.

Frontend: I utilized React.js for the development of the user interface, ensuring a fast and responsive experience. The UI components were built using Material UI for consistency and ease of use.

Backend: The backend was built with Node.js and Express.js, allowing for scalable and fast handling of requests. We employed REST APIs to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.

Database: We used PostgreSQL for efficient and reliable data storage, ensuring the system could handle thousands of daily transactions without performance degradation.

Payment Integration: Integrated Stripe for secure payments, enabling users to make bookings with ease.

Deployment: The application was deployed on AWS, utilizing services like EC2 for hosting and S3 for static file storage.

Challenges Overcome:

Ensuring the search function returned fast results even with a large dataset.

Implementing secure user authentication and payment processing systems.

Balancing the design for a wide range of devices, ensuring consistent performance on both mobile and desktop.

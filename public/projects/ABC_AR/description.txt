🚀 What it is

It’s ABC’s AR experience focused on space; an educational and interactive app. 


Aimed at letting people, especially families and students, engage with space concepts through AR. 


🔍 Key Features / Activities

The app offers three main interactive activities: 


Explore Jupiter
You can view a 3D model of Jupiter and learn about its interesting properties. The user can place the model in their real environment via AR. 


Assemble the ISS (International Space Station)
Users can “fly the parts” of the ISS together piece-by-piece, learning what each part does as it’s assembled. 


Space Debris (Space Junk Defense)
A game-like mode: defend the ISS from incoming space debris using laser/futuristic tools. It gives a playful but informative view on the issue of space debris. 


🎯 Purpose & Context

It was developed in conjunction with “Stargazing Live” (a TV program) to complement live broadcasts; so while the show discusses certain objects (like the ISS), users can explore those objects themselves via AR. 


It's meant to make space science more tangible and immersive. Instead of reading or seeing on screen, learners can “place” virtual space objects in their living room, see them from all sides, interact with them. 


⚙️ Technical & Availability

Released ~2018. 


Available for iOS and Android devices that support AR. 


The app is relatively large: e.g. one listing says ~211 MB on iOS. 


👍 Benefits & Limitations

Benefits

Good tool for education: helps with understanding spatial relationships and scale in space.

Engaging format: gamified parts (assembling, defending ISS) make learning more fun.

AR can help with retention: seeing models in 3D in your environment can make it more memorable.

Limitations / Considerations

Requires a device capable of AR; older phones or unsupported devices may not work.

Since it was tied to a TV program, some of its content might feel dated if not updated.

AR experiences depend also on lighting, space in user’s room, etc., so real-world constraints can limit the experience.

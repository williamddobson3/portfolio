One of the most exciting projects I worked on was an AR educational app about space, created in partnership with the TV program Stargazing Live. The goal was to make space science more interactive and engaging, especially for families and students.

The app centered around three main experiences:

Explore Jupiter – Users could place a detailed 3D model of Jupiter into their real-world environment and explore its unique features from every angle.

Assemble the ISS – This mode let users build the International Space Station piece by piece, learning the role of each component as they put it together.

Space Debris Defense – A game-like challenge where players protected the ISS from incoming space junk using futuristic tools, making the serious issue of space debris both fun and memorable.

The purpose was to go beyond what people saw on TV or read in textbooks, and instead let them experience space objects up close in their own living rooms. By blending education with play, the app helped learners understand scale, structure, and real-world challenges in space in a way that was both immersive and enjoyable.

From a technical perspective, the app was built with Unity for the 3D and AR functionality, with C# scripting, and leveraged ARKit (iOS) and ARCore (Android) for the AR features. It was released on both iOS and Android around 2018, and due to the rich 3D content, the app was fairly large (about 200MB+).

This project gave me valuable hands-on experience in building large-scale AR applications, optimizing 3D models for performance, and creating interactive learning experiences that balance education and entertainment. It also taught me how to design for real-world conditions, since AR depends heavily on the user’s environment, lighting, and device capabilities.

Overall, it was a project that combined my technical expertise with my passion for making learning more engaging through technology.

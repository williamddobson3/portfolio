During my time working on Ravelry, I had the opportunity to contribute to one of the most beloved hubs for fiber arts in the world — a place where knitters, crocheters, and craft lovers gather to share inspiration and organize their creative lives. It wasn’t just a project; it was a journey into building a living, breathing community.

Ravelry is more than a website — it’s a community-driven platform that blends a social network with powerful tools for personal project management. My work involved developing and enhancing features that make this possible.

I helped shape the Patterns section, where thousands of knitting and crochet patterns live — both free and paid. Users can save their favorites, leave reviews, and link patterns directly to their projects. This meant creating intuitive interfaces and ensuring the backend supported seamless searches and personalization.

On the Project Tracking side, I worked to give users a place to log ongoing and completed projects. Every detail mattered — yarn type, tools used, photos of finished pieces — so I made sure the system could handle rich project data while remaining easy to use.

For Stash Management, I helped build a tool that allows crafters to manage their yarn inventory, tools, and supplies. This required a deep understanding of database optimization so that users could quickly find what they already owned before making new purchases.

Beyond tools, I contributed to community features such as Forums & Groups, enabling discussions around techniques, yarn brands, and craft ideas. These spaces became a cornerstone of Ravelry’s vibrant ecosystem.

The project also involved working with a robust tech stack, including Ruby on Rails, MySQL, Redis, Sphinx Search, and Amazon S3, alongside frontend enhancements using Node.js, Prototype.js, and Prism.js. Ensuring smooth performance and stability required careful optimization across layers, from caching with Memcached to load balancing with HAProxy.

Through this experience, I learned not just technical skills, but how to design for a passionate community — blending technical excellence with empathy for user needs. Building Ravelry was not only about writing code, it was about weaving together people, projects, and passion into something lasting.

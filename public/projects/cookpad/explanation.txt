Challenges & Solutions

Scalability: With millions of recipes and growing traffic, performance was a major challenge. I implemented database indexing and caching strategies that kept queries fast and responsive.

Mobile Optimization: Since a large percentage of users accessed the site via mobile, I invested significant effort into responsive layouts and flexible grid systems, ensuring an intuitive experience on all screen sizes.

User Engagement: To keep the community active, I helped develop features like recipe ratings, comments, and social sharing. These additions increased interaction and boosted user-generated content.

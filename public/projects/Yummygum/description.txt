Since 2009, Yummygum — a small but passionate digital product agency based in Amsterdam — has been on a mission: to transform good products into something truly remarkable. Founded by Vince Schwidder and Leon Ephraïm, the agency has grown into a tight-knit team of under 50 experts with nearly two decades of experience in design and development.

My journey with Yummygum has been nothing short of inspiring. Working alongside visionary designers, strategists, and developers, I’ve had the privilege of contributing to projects that shape the way people interact with technology. We’ve partnered with ambitious companies like Vio.com, Spider Strategies, On My Way, and Watermelon — collaborations that have helped our clients secure over $130 million in funding.

At Yummygum, every project starts with understanding the core challenge. Whether it’s a UX/UI audit, accessibility review, or technical consultation, I work hand in hand with the team to create strategies that align design and development seamlessly.

My work covers a broad spectrum: crafting intuitive UX/UI designs, building responsive websites, developing robust back-end systems, and delivering polished mobile applications. I’m deeply involved in both the creative and technical sides — from brand strategy and creative direction to front-end development and back-end architecture.

Our technical stack reflects this holistic approach:

Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, React, Storybook, GSAP, Framer, Zustand, Vercel, Netlify.

Backend & CMS: DatoCMS.

Mobile: React Native (Expo).

CI/CD & Monitoring: GitHub Actions, Sentry.

Each tool and technology I use is chosen to bring efficiency and quality to the projects. But for me, development is more than code — it’s about creating experiences that spark joy for users and growth for clients.

At Yummygum, we live by values that guide everything we do: growth, excellence, joy, and synergy. These aren’t just words — they’re the reason why every line of code, every design decision, and every collaboration carries a deeper purpose.

Through these experiences, I’ve learned that the real art of development lies in connecting creativity and technology — turning ideas into products that don’t just work, but inspire.

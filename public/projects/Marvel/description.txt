When I worked on marvel.com, I wasn’t just building a website — I was helping create the central gateway for millions of fans to explore the Marvel Universe. My role combined technical skill, creative problem solving, and a deep focus on user experience.

The site is more than just a collection of pages — it’s a dynamic hub with multiple sections, each offering a unique journey for Marvel fans:

Movies — a dedicated space where fans can explore the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from iconic classics to upcoming releases like Thunderbolts and Captain America: Brave New World.

Comics — a massive library with thousands of titles, made accessible through Marvel Unlimited, letting fans dive deep into Marvel’s storytelling universe.

Characters — detailed profiles of heroes, villains, and supporting cast, giving fans an immersive experience.

TV Shows — keeping audiences up to date with series like Marvel Zombies and Ironheart.

Games — connecting fans with Marvel-themed gaming experiences.

Videos — trailers, interviews, behind-the-scenes content, and more.

Shop — a carefully crafted space for official Marvel merchandise.

On the technical side, building marvel.com required mastering a diverse stack of technologies — from WordPress and Next.js for front-end performance, to Django and Perl for back-end operations. I worked with Git for version control, Gradle for automation, and tools like Optimizely, Sizmek, and Looker to deliver a high-quality, data-driven site. Analytics tools like Kochava and SEO structures like Schema ensured the site was optimized for both users and search engines.

This wasn’t just development — it was about creating a seamless, rich, and interactive platform that brought Marvel’s world to life. It taught me how to balance cutting-edge technology with storytelling, ensuring fans everywhere could connect with the Marvel experience in the most intuitive and exciting way possible.

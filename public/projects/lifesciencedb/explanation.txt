Overview:
BodyParts3D (BP3D) is an interactive platform that allows users to explore detailed 3D models of human anatomy. The website provides an interface for selecting body parts, adjusting visualization parameters, and embedding or exporting 3D anatomical models.

Experience & Development Process:

User Interface Design: Focused on making the platform intuitive, ensuring users could interact easily with complex 3D models. Considerations included accessibility and ease of navigation to browse body parts and customize models.

3D Model Rendering: The backend uses WebGL, a powerful JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics in a browser without needing plug-ins. This technology was essential to deliver high-quality, real-time anatomical visualizations.

Data Management: The site utilizes a structured database for storing detailed anatomical data, including models of bones, muscles, and vessels. Integration with external medical databases (like FMA) helps ensure the accuracy and consistency of the anatomical data.

Tech Stack Used:

Frontend:

JavaScript: Core scripting language for interactive elements on the page.

WebGL: For rendering 3D models in the browser.

Three.js: Likely used for simplifying 3D graphics handling and manipulation, making it easier to work with WebGL.

HTML5/CSS3: For layout and styling the website.

Backend:

Node.js or similar JavaScript-based environments might be used for server-side processing and handling user requests.

Database: Likely a combination of relational and NoSQL databases to store the anatomical data, user interactions, and models.

APIs and Data Integration:

Integration with external datasets such as FMA (Foundational Model of Anatomy) helps enrich the database with detailed, accurate anatomical structures.

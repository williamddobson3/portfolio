During my time working on RallyPoint, I had the opportunity to contribute to a platform that truly makes a difference for the U.S. military community — connecting active service members, veterans, and their families in ways that empower both their professional and personal lives.

RallyPoint isn’t just another network — it’s a vibrant ecosystem where members share stories, exchange advice, and build meaningful connections. My role was to bring this vision to life through thoughtful and robust engineering.

On the frontend, I worked extensively with React, crafting intuitive interfaces that allow users to easily navigate discussions, mentorship opportunities, and career resources. The goal was to make interactions smooth, so the technology felt invisible and the community experience felt natural.

On the backend, I worked with Node.js and Express.js to ensure reliable, high-performance services. This included building APIs to connect users with relevant discussions, career opportunities, and unit-specific content. The backend also handled real-time interactions and integrated authentication via OAuth and JWT to ensure secure and seamless access.

I designed and optimized the PostgreSQL database to efficiently manage large volumes of user data, while Redis was employed for caching to improve speed. For search functionality, I integrated Elasticsearch, enabling users to quickly find relevant conversations or resources.

The platform was hosted on AWS, with services running inside Docker containers for scalability and maintainability. I also implemented monitoring with Sentry to proactively detect and fix issues, while Google Analytics provided insights into user engagement. For communication and notifications, we integrated SendGrid.

What made RallyPoint special was not just the technical challenge — it was the mission. Every feature I developed, every optimization I made, was in service of a community that deserved a seamless and powerful platform to connect. Seeing the platform grow into a trusted space for mentorship, professional networking, and camaraderie was deeply rewarding.

Through RallyPoint, I strengthened my skills across the full stack — but more importantly, I learned the power of building technology that truly serves people’s lives.

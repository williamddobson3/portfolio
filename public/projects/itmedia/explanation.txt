When I joined the ITmedia redevelopment project, the challenge was clear — the system was outdated, struggled under heavy traffic, and lacked a smooth editorial workflow. My mission was to modernize the tech stack, improve performance under high load, and make publishing easier for editors. I took the lead on both front-end and back-end development, and it quickly became a project full of both technical challenges and rewarding breakthroughs.

On the front end, I started by untangling years of legacy code. I refactored everything into clean, modular ES6 components, introduced Webpack bundling with code splitting, and implemented lazy loading for below-the-fold content. I even inlined critical CSS so that the first render felt almost instant. For dynamic sections like “related articles” and “live feed,” I built React widgets, while keeping core article pages server-rendered to preserve SEO. This hybrid approach gave readers both speed and interactivity.

The back end was a whole different beast. We built it on Laravel (PHP) and split responsibilities for better scalability — MySQL for content storage and Elasticsearch for search indexing. One big hurdle was handling traffic spikes when an article went viral. My solution was to introduce Redis-based caching on multiple levels: page caching, fragment caching, and object caching. To keep things smooth at scale, we deployed everything in Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes on AWS, with auto-scaling to meet demand. Deployments were automated through CI pipelines in GitHub Actions, with blue/green releases to avoid downtime — because nobody wants their site to go down when an article suddenly blows up.

I also wanted to make life easier for the editorial team. I built a custom CMS interface with draft scheduling, device preview, media asset management, and role-based permissions. Editors could see how articles would look before publishing, and everything was integrated with analytics and Sentry for real-time performance and error tracking. This wasn’t just a technical upgrade — it was a complete improvement in the editorial workflow.

The results were clear. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) dropped from around 3 seconds to about 1.2 seconds. Bounce rates on mobile decreased. Editors could publish articles faster and with more confidence. Over time, we learned valuable lessons about performance budgets, aggressive caching strategies, and finding the balance between dynamic interactivity and SEO-friendly server rendering.

Looking forward, we’re planning even bigger changes — introducing PWA features, exploring edge rendering with Cloudflare Workers or Vercel Edge, and adding AI-powered content recommendations to make the experience smarter for readers. This project wasn’t just about rewriting code — it was about reimagining how ITmedia delivers content in a modern, high-performance way.

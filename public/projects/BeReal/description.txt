BeReal is a social media app designed to promote authenticity by encouraging users to share unfiltered photos of themselves and their surroundings. Unlike traditional platforms, BeReal notifies all users simultaneously at a random time each day, giving them a two-minute window to post a dual-camera snapshot without filters or edits. This approach aims to capture genuine moments, emphasizing real-life experiences over curated content.

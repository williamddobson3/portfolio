During my time working with Doximity, I was part of a journey to build and evolve one of the largest digital platforms for U.S. healthcare professionals. Launched in 2011, Doximity grew into a network that now connects over 80% of U.S. physicians and more than 50% of nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Being part of this story was not just about coding — it was about contributing to a product that empowers doctors, improves patient care, and shapes the future of healthcare.

My role involved working across the platform’s front-end, back-end, mobile, and infrastructure layers — helping bring innovative features to life while ensuring stability and scalability.

On the front-end, I worked with Nuxt.js and Backbone.js, building interfaces that deliver a seamless experience for doctors and medical teams. This included professional profile pages, the personalized DocNews feed, and telehealth tools that needed to be both fast and intuitive.

On the back-end, I contributed to complex systems built with Ruby on Rails and Go, supported by GraphQL APIs, Elasticsearch, Kafka, and Neo4j. These systems processed sensitive healthcare data with HIPAA-compliant security, powering core features like secure messaging and clinical decision support.

In the mobile space, I developed and optimized applications for both iOS (Swift, RxSwift) and Android (Kotlin). One of the most rewarding projects was enhancing Doximity Dialer — enabling physicians to call patients directly from their phones while displaying the office number, and expanding this to video consultations with integrated clinical guidance through partnerships like UpToDate.

I also had the opportunity to work with data and analytics tools such as Python, Snowflake, and Hex to ensure data-driven decision-making across the platform. On the infrastructure side, we relied on AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform to maintain a robust and scalable environment.

Working at Doximity also meant supporting rapid innovation and strategic growth. I was involved during exciting milestones, including the acquisition of Amion (on-call scheduling) and Pathway Medical (AI-based clinical tools), and the integration of powerful partnerships that brought cutting-edge capabilities to healthcare professionals.

For me, this wasn’t just software development — it was building tools that doctors trust, enabling better healthcare, and contributing to a platform recognized as a leader in telehealth and medical collaboration.

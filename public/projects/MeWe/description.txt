MeWe is a privacy-focused social networking platform that emphasizes user control and data security. Founded in 2016 by Mark Weinstein, it aims to provide an alternative to mainstream social media platforms by prioritizing user privacy and freedom from targeted advertising.

üîë Key Features

Ad-Free Experience: MeWe does not display ads or engage in targeted advertising, ensuring a cleaner and more user-centric environment. 

User Data Ownership: Users retain full ownership of their data and content, with MeWe committing not to sell or misuse personal information. 


Privacy Bill of Rights: The platform operates under a "Privacy Bill of Rights," guaranteeing users control over their newsfeed, privacy settings, and content visibility. 


Chronological Newsfeed: Unlike platforms that use algorithms to prioritize content, MeWe presents posts in chronological order, allowing users to see updates as they are posted. 


Group and Chat Features: Users can create and join groups, participate in private or group chats, and share content within these communities. 


Dual-Camera Videos: Introduced in 2020, this feature allows users to record videos using both the front and rear cameras simultaneously. 


üåê Platform and Accessibility

Availability: MeWe is accessible via web browsers and mobile applications, supporting both iOS and Android devices. 


User Base: As of recent reports, MeWe has over 20 million registered users worldwide. 


üîÑ Future Developments

Transition to Decentralized Web: MeWe plans to migrate its platform to a decentralized web infrastructure, aligning with Project Liberty's decentralized social networking protocol (DSNP).

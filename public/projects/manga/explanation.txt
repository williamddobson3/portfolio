“From zero to launch: building MangaONE”

During the initial phase, we set up the backend APIs and object storage for chapter pages, and integrated a global CDN to ensure fast load times for readers across Japan (and potentially overseas).

The challenge was handling high concurrency: when a new popular manga chapter drops, thousands of users may access it simultaneously. We designed a caching + load-balancer + auto-scaling architecture to mitigate this.

For the “free reads / lives” system, we built a small stateful service that maintains users’ remaining reads per day, resets at scheduled times (9 AM / 9 PM), and is consistent under concurrent access.

Mobile support involved writing native iOS/Android apps that sync reading progress, prefetch several pages ahead, and gracefully handle offline / network transitions.

Content management (CMS) enabled editors to upload new manga pages, set metadata, schedule publication, and preview before making live.

Performance tuning focused on optimizing image formats, enabling progressive loading, using lazy loading, and compressing images smartly while preserving clarity.

Monitoring & continuous improvement allowed us to catch slow endpoints, track user drop-off points, refine recommendation heuristics, and plan capacity scaling.

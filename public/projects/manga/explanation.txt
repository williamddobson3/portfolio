From Zero to Launch: Building MangaONE

When we first started MangaONE, we were building something from scratch — not just an app, but an entire experience for manga readers. The first challenge was setting up the backbone: backend APIs, object storage for chapter pages, and a global CDN to make sure readers anywhere in Japan — and potentially overseas — could load pages instantly without delay.

One of the toughest challenges was handling high concurrency. Imagine this: a brand-new chapter of a hit manga drops, and within minutes thousands of readers flood the app. To handle this, we designed a robust system combining caching, load balancing, and auto-scaling so the service stayed fast and reliable even under massive load.

For the “free reads” system, we built a small but critical stateful service. It keeps track of each user’s daily remaining reads, resets counts at exactly 9 AM and 9 PM, and maintains consistency even when thousands of users are reading at once. This was a subtle but essential feature that required careful design to make the experience seamless.

On the mobile side, we built native iOS and Android apps that truly focused on the reader experience. They sync reading progress across devices, prefetch pages so there’s no waiting, and gracefully handle offline reading or network transitions. The goal was to make reading as smooth and uninterrupted as possible.

On the content side, we built a powerful CMS that gave editors the tools to upload new chapters, set metadata, schedule releases, and preview content before going live. It turned what could be a slow process into something agile and efficient.

Performance was always a priority. We optimized image formats, enabled progressive loading, implemented lazy loading, and used smart compression techniques so that image clarity stayed high while load times stayed low.

Finally, monitoring and continuous improvement became a core part of the process. We tracked slow endpoints, identified where users dropped off, refined recommendation algorithms, and planned capacity expansions before they became urgent. Every iteration was driven by both data and user feedback.

By the time we launched, MangaONE was more than just an app — it was a platform designed with both scale and delight in mind. The journey from zero to launch wasn’t just about coding; it was about solving problems, anticipating challenges, and creating something readers would love.

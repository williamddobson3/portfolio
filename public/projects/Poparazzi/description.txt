No Likes or Followers: The app removed traditional social media metrics like likes and follower counts, focusing on genuine interactions. 


Pop Score: A feature that gamified the experience by tracking how many photos a user had taken of others. 


No Filters or Captions: To maintain authenticity, the app did not allow photo filters or captions.

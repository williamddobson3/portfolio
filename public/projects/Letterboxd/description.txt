Back in 2011, Letterboxd was born in New Zealand as a small passion project for film lovers. Over the years, it grew into one of the most beloved social platforms for cinephiles, now with over 17 million users worldwide (as of January 2025). I had the opportunity to be part of this journey, contributing to building features that turned Letterboxd into more than just a movie tracker — it became a global community.

My work spanned both frontend and backend development, weaving together a complex yet seamless experience for users. On the frontend, I worked with React, jQuery, and RequireJS, crafting intuitive interfaces with HTML5 and CSS3 that felt alive and responsive. Every detail mattered — from how films were logged and rated to how reviews and lists came to life visually.

On the backend, I dived into Node.js and Ruby on Rails, ensuring robust performance and reliability. I worked with PostgreSQL to handle massive amounts of film data, while NGINX powered efficient delivery. This foundation allowed users to log films, write reviews, curate lists, and connect with others without friction.

Beyond coding, I collaborated closely with designers, product managers, and fellow engineers to deliver a cohesive experience. We integrated tools like Google Analytics for insights, Playwire RAMP SDK for ad monetization, and Firebase for authentication. In some cases, we worked with MongoDB to handle unique datasets, balancing flexibility and performance.

Letterboxd also embraced growth and innovation. After the acquisition by Tiny in 2023, the platform expanded into TV shows. In 2024, we launched a curated online film rental service at the Festival de Cannes, bringing festival-style experiences to fans worldwide. I was proud to contribute to these developments, helping to transform Letterboxd into a richer, more immersive platform.

For me, working on Letterboxd wasn’t just about building a product — it was about crafting a digital space where film lovers could connect, share, and celebrate cinema together.

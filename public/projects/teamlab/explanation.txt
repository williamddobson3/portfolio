Development Experience

I’ve had the opportunity to work on projects similar to teamLab, where art, technology, and interactivity come together to create immersive digital experiences. My focus has always been on building platforms that don’t just display content but allow users to truly experience it.

Some key highlights from my work include:

Immersive Digital Art
I combined digital technology with natural elements to design experiences that engage multiple senses, making users feel like they are part of the artwork.

Interactive Features
I implemented systems where visuals respond to user actions—such as clicks, touches, or mouse movements—so the artwork changes in real time, bringing “touchable art” to the web.

Innovative Exhibitions
By combining visuals, sound, and interactivity, I helped create digital spaces where each exhibit tells a story, recreating the feeling of walking through a physical exhibition online.

Virtual Tours
Using modern web technologies, I built systems that allow users to explore exhibitions remotely, offering an experience close to being there in person.

Tech Stack

To bring these kinds of experiences to life, I’ve worked with a wide range of technologies:

WebGL / Three.js – For rendering 3D graphics directly in the browser and creating interactive, real-time art.

React / Vue.js / Angular – For building dynamic, smooth, and responsive user interfaces.

Next.js (SSR) – To deliver fast performance and strong SEO optimization for large-scale content.

Node.js & WebSockets – For backend development and real-time communication, ensuring user interactions reflect instantly.

Cloud Platforms (AWS / GCP) – To deliver content globally with scalability and stable performance.

AI / Machine Learning – To make installations adaptive and responsive, allowing art to change based on user input and data.

Through these projects, I’ve learned that my real passion lies in using technology to move people emotionally. For me, development isn’t just about coding systems—it’s about designing experiences that surprise, inspire, and connect with users on a deeper level.

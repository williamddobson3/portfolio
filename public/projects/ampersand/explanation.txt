Development Experience

Building the Ampersand website was a team effort where my focus was on delivering a smooth and engaging user experience from start to finish. The project went through several key stages:

Planning & Strategy – We started by clearly defining the website’s goals and identifying the target audience to make sure the design and features matched user needs.

Design – I worked on wireframes and prototypes to shape the interface and ensure the flow felt intuitive.

Development – Using modern web technologies, I built the site with clean, scalable code that could grow with future needs.

Testing – I carried out usability and cross-device testing to make sure the site worked seamlessly across browsers and platforms.

Launch – Once deployed, I monitored performance and fine-tuned the site for stability and speed.

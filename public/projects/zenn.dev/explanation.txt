Tech Stack and Development Experience for Zenn.dev

Here’s an overview of the technologies and development approach behind Zenn.dev. This reflects both the technical choices and the mindset I applied during development.

Frontend

React.js: Built the interactive and dynamic user interface with React, enabling a smooth, responsive experience. React’s efficient state management and rendering made it possible to deliver high performance for content-heavy pages.

Next.js: Used Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), ensuring fast page loads and strong SEO performance. It also allowed seamless integration of serverless functions when necessary.

TypeScript: Adopted TypeScript to improve maintainability and catch errors early. Strong typing helped streamline development and reduce runtime issues.

Tailwind CSS: Chose Tailwind for utility-first styling, enabling rapid UI development while keeping designs clean, responsive, and easy to customize.

Backend

Ruby on Rails: Developed the backend API with Ruby on Rails for its developer-friendly conventions and rapid iteration capability. Rails powered user authentication, article management, and content storage with a clean, RESTful architecture.

PostgreSQL: Relied on PostgreSQL for a scalable, reliable database solution. It handled complex queries and stored user data, article content, and metadata efficiently.

Redis: Used Redis for caching frequently accessed data, improving response times for high-traffic features like profiles and article views.

Deployment & Infrastructure

Docker: Containerized the application to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

AWS: Leveraged AWS services such as EC2 for hosting, S3 for asset storage, and CloudFront for CDN, ensuring scalability and reliability.

GitHub Actions: Automated CI/CD pipelines to streamline testing, building, and deployment processes.

Additional Tools

GraphQL: Employed GraphQL for precise data fetching, avoiding over-fetching and improving performance.

Prisma ORM: Used Prisma to simplify database querying and management.

Algolia: Integrated Algolia to provide fast, relevant search capabilities for users.

My Development Experience

Working on Zenn.dev wasn’t just about building a product — it was about crafting an experience that’s powerful, intuitive, and user-friendly.

User-Centric Design: I focused on making Zenn accessible and enjoyable for both creators and readers. The UI was designed to be minimal yet powerful, ensuring smooth navigation and clarity.

Rich Content Support: Built robust support for Markdown, allowing creators to embed code snippets, images, and videos easily. This gave users flexibility to craft visually rich, engaging posts.

Mobile-First Approach: With mobile browsing becoming dominant, I ensured Zenn was fully responsive. Every interaction was optimized for a smooth mobile experience without sacrificing desktop performance.

Community Building: Integrated features like user following, likes, comments, and notifications to foster an engaged community. Social interactions were designed to feel natural and seamless.

Real-Time Collaboration: Developed live preview and synchronization features so creators could edit content with confidence, enabling faster iterations and smoother workflows.

This project was a journey of blending technology and empathy — making thoughtful choices that enhance both performance and user experience.

During my time working on Soundraw, I had the chance to contribute to a truly unique project — an AI-powered music generation platform designed to empower creators with custom, royalty-free music tailored to their needs. This was more than just a technical challenge; it was a creative journey that blended cutting-edge AI with real-world user needs.

One of the most exciting parts of the project was building the core music generation system. We designed it so that users could simply choose mood, genre, tempo, and instrumentation, and the AI would instantly create an original track. Behind the scenes, I worked closely with the team to ensure that this process was smooth and intuitive.

To make the platform genuinely flexible for creators, I helped develop powerful customization tools — enabling users to shorten intros, rearrange choruses, or tweak arrangements without touching a complex DAW. The mixer interface became a highlight feature, letting creators toggle instruments, adjust intensity, and set track lengths with ease. This required thoughtful collaboration between frontend and backend teams to ensure responsiveness and reliability.

On the technical side, I worked across the stack — from Ruby on Rails backend systems to a JavaScript/Vue.js frontend (while we explored transitioning to TypeScript and React), integrating our AI models written in Python, and managing PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases. I also contributed to infrastructure and deployment pipelines on Heroku and AWS, using CircleCI for CI/CD, and ensured stability through monitoring with Papertrail and BugSnag.

What stood out most was the platform’s in-house training process — our AI was trained exclusively on Soundraw’s original music, guaranteeing every track was unique and royalty-free. This meant working closely with data engineers and ML specialists to maintain a robust pipeline and quality control.

The result was something creators could truly rely on — unlimited, high-quality downloads of WAV files or stems, ready for any creative project. Whether for YouTube videos, podcasts, films, games, or music production, Soundraw became a tool that blended creativity with technical precision.

Working on Soundraw wasn’t just about coding — it was about building a product that empowers people to create music in a way that’s personal, professional, and truly innovative.

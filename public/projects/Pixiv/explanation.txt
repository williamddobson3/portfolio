Pixiv â€” Development Experience & Contributions

Working as a core developer on Pixiv was more than just writing code â€” it was about shaping the heart of one of the worldâ€™s largest communities for artists and creators. My role stretched across design, architecture, scaling, and collaboration, helping turn ideas into features used by over 100 million users worldwide.

My Role & Responsibilities

From day one, my focus was on creating experiences that would make Pixiv both powerful and delightful. I took ownership of several core areas:

Front-end architecture â€” designed and implemented the home feed, ranking systems, and tag-based discovery features, making it easier for users to find art that inspires them.

Artwork upload pipeline â€” built the system from the ground up, including client-side validation, asset optimization, previews, and version control, ensuring creators could share their work smoothly.

Social features â€” developed comments, image responses, and interaction modules (favoriting, following, replies) that made the platform truly social.

Admin & moderation tools â€” crafted internal dashboards for event management, moderation, analytics, and premium user controls, streamlining operations behind the scenes.

Cross-team collaboration â€” worked closely with backend, infrastructure, and security teams to integrate fraud detection, content moderation, and scaling strategies.

Product planning â€” participated in design and roadmap discussions to balance UX, performance, and long-term growth.

Impact & Achievements

The features and tools I helped build werenâ€™t just code â€” they directly shaped Pixivâ€™s growth and the experience of its millions of users.

Supported over 100 million registered users and 115 million artworks and novels.

Enabled Pixivâ€™s global expansion through a hybrid cloud infrastructure using Google Cloud.

Strengthened fraud protection with Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise and custom detection systems.

Launched the "Requests" feature, giving fans a direct way to commission creators, boosting monetization and engagement.

Established a feature-tracking system (PixivFE) for smooth front-end experimentation and rollouts.

These efforts improved site performance, built trust in the community, boosted retention, and supported sustainable growth for Pixiv.

Technical Architecture & Stack

While my work spanned product design and engineering, it was grounded in a robust technical foundation:

Frontend: TypeScript, React (with a custom UI framework), Sass/CSS Modules, Webpack, client-side routing

Backend/API: Java, Python microservices, REST/GraphQL

Data & Storage: MySQL/PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch

Media & Assets: Cloud object storage, image resizing services, CDN integration

Infrastructure: Hybrid on-premises + Google Cloud, Kubernetes, load balancing

Security: Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise, custom heuristics

Analytics: Google Analytics, Stackdriver, Prometheus

DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes (GKE), Terraform, CI/CD pipelines

ðŸ’¡ Story highlight:
One memory that stands out is when we were tackling a sudden surge of traffic during a global art challenge. The site faced unprecedented load, and users were uploading tens of thousands of artworks within hours. By deploying improved CDN caching and lazy loading systems we designed, we kept the feed snappy â€” even under extreme load. Seeing artists from around the world still able to engage without delay was a rewarding reminder of how deep engineering and user experience go hand in hand.

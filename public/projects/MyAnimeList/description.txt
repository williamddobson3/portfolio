When I worked on MyAnimeList (MAL), it wasn’t just about building a website — it was about creating a community hub for anime and manga fans worldwide. MAL is more than a platform; it’s where people track their favorite series, share opinions, discover new titles, and connect over a shared passion. Being part of its development taught me the importance of both technical precision and user experience.

The Goal
Our mission was clear: make it easy for millions of fans to organize their anime and manga collections, write reviews, share recommendations, and join conversations. This meant balancing heavy data loads with smooth, intuitive interactions, and ensuring a vibrant community experience.

My Role in Development
On the frontend, I worked extensively with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, bringing MAL’s interface to life. For dynamic user interactions — such as list management, ratings, and recommendations — I integrated jQuery, React components, and AJAX for seamless asynchronous updates without disrupting the user experience.

On the backend, I designed robust APIs and data structures using PHP and MySQL. This enabled features like personal tracking lists, seasonal charts, and ranking algorithms to function reliably at scale. For performance and scalability, the system ran on Apache with Nginx as a reverse proxy, ensuring smooth traffic handling during peak usage.

Infrastructure & Scaling
Hosting on Amazon Web Services (AWS) gave us flexibility and reliability. We used Amazon CloudFront for fast content delivery and Amazon S3 for secure storage of large media files. Amazon API Gateway allowed efficient API management, keeping our backend responsive and scalable.

Security & Optimization
Security was a top priority. We implemented SSL/TLS for secure connections, along with Cloudflare and Akamai to enhance performance, protect against attacks, and ensure smooth access for users across the globe.

The Result
By combining thoughtful design with scalable backend systems, we created a platform that not only manages massive amounts of data but also connects people through shared passion. MAL became a place where fans can explore new anime seasons, discover hidden gems, and participate in lively discussions — all in a secure, fast, and enjoyable environment.

Working on MAL taught me how to bridge technical complexity with user-focused design, and it strengthened my ability to build systems that are both powerful and engaging. It wasn’t just development — it was crafting an experience.

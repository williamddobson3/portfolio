Tech Stack Used for Developing Zenn.dev:

Frontend:

React.js: The interactive and dynamic user interface is built using React.js, which helps provide a fast and responsive user experience. React allows seamless state management and renders updates efficiently.

Next.js: Next.js is used for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). It enables faster page load times and improves SEO. It also provides the flexibility to add serverless functions when needed.

TypeScript: Zenn uses TypeScript for enhanced developer productivity, providing type safety, better code maintainability, and reduced runtime errors.

Tailwind CSS: The sleek and modern design of Zenn is powered by Tailwind CSS, which enables utility-first styling to quickly build responsive and highly customizable UI components.

Backend:

Ruby on Rails: The backend API of Zenn is built using Ruby on Rails, known for its developer-friendly conventions and rapid development speed. Rails provides a RESTful API and powers the user authentication, article management, and content storage.

PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is used as the relational database for storing user data, article content, and metadata, offering scalability, reliability, and complex querying capabilities.

Redis: Redis is used for caching to speed up content delivery and reduce database load, particularly for high-traffic features like user profiles and article views.

Deployment and Infrastructure:

Docker: Docker containers help ensure that Zenn's development, testing, and production environments are consistent, isolated, and easy to manage.

AWS (Amazon Web Services): Zenn leverages AWS services such as EC2 instances for hosting, S3 for asset storage, and CloudFront for content delivery (CDN).

CI/CD (GitHub Actions): GitHub Actions automates continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, ensuring code is tested, built, and deployed seamlessly to production.

Other Tools and Libraries:

GraphQL: Zenn may use GraphQL for efficient data fetching, enabling the frontend to request exactly the data it needs, without over-fetching.

Prisma ORM: Prisma ORM may be used for database management, making querying easier and safer.

Algolia: Zenn could use Algolia for powerful and fast search capabilities, making it easy for users to find the articles they’re interested in.
